"""WorkloadAdapter interface — one per engine.

An adapter owns exactly four things: its driver, its introspection statements, its
proposal rules, and its DDL syntax. Parsing, redaction and the usage rollup are shared,
engine-agnostic code so they are implemented and audited once.

This is deliberately *not* an extension of PerfAdapter: PerfAdapter analyzes one SQL
string offline, whereas a WorkloadAdapter analyzes a corpus against a live catalog.
